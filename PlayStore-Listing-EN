Track your Cargo Hold while mining, with ease!

Are you an amazing mining multi-tasker? I really wanted to be, but I kept finding my Cargo Hold full and the mining lasers off, so I created this app. It takes all of the guess work out of timing when to look at the screen and empty your ore (or ice).

Timer tracks your mining cycles, your target size, total time and cargo hold, while alerting to cycles that will not fit in your Cargo Hold. Works for Ice and Rock mining!

NOW with completely overhauled Mining Drone options and Cargo / Ore Hold Capacity Gauge! We have timed more and 2,000 asteroid mining cycles to get a more accurate timer for you!

Even works for Null Sec.
